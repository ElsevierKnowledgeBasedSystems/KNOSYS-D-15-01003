<h1>Examples of server-side agents</h1>
	
This page contains the list of server-side agents with short descriptions and instructions for testing. 
This list is not final, and will be modified in time.

<h2>1. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gcvt/siebog/tree/v1.3.1/TestAgent/src/agent/TestAgent.java">TestAgent</a></h2>
<p>
This is a simple example of agent which dumps the content of the received message. 
This is a template for creating new agents.	All new agents should be created in separate EJB projects. 
Please pay attention to the META-INF/manifest.mf file, since it contains one line that defines the dependancy on the siebog framework.
<b>Note: The TestAgent example, as well as all external agents (separate EJB projects) cannot be run from the standalone binary of siebog as they need to be deployed separately.</b>
</p>
<h3>Create test agent</h3>	
To create the TestAgent, please <button class="btn btn-default" ng-click="aesc.createTestAgent()">click here</button>. 
This will create one agent with the name <code>test</code>. Do this only once.
<h3>Send message to the test agent</h3>	
To send the message to the TestAgent, please <button class="btn btn-primary" ng-click="aesc.sendMessageToTestAgent()">click here</button>.

<h2>2. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gcvt/siebog/tree/v1.3.1/siebog/test/siebog/agents/test/pingpong/Ping.java">Ping</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gcvt/siebog/tree/v1.3.1/siebog/test/siebog/agents/test/pingpong/Pong.java">Pong</a> agents</h2>
This example gives an overview of inter-agent communications (how to send message, how to reply, etc.).
<h3>Create ping and pong agents</h3>	
Two agents need to be created: <code>ping</code> and <code>pong</code>. To do so, please <button class="btn btn-default" ng-click="aesc.createPingAndPongAgents()">click here</button>. Do this only once.
<h3>Initiate communication</h3>	
The communication will be initiated by sending the REQUEST performative to the <code>ping</code> agent.
The content of the message will be the name of the pong agent: <code>pong</code>.
The <code>pong</code> agent will reply to the <code>ping</code> agent by sending the INFORM performative.
The message exchange can be observed on the wildfly console.
To initiate communication, please <button class="btn btn-primary" ng-click="aesc.sendMessageToPingAgent()">click here</button>.

<h2>3. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gcvt/siebog/tree/v1.3.1/siebog/src/siebog/agents/xjaf/aco/tsp/Map.java">Map</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gcvt/siebog/tree/v1.3.1/siebog/src/siebog/agents/xjaf/aco/tsp/Ant.java">Ant</a> agents</h2>
This example is an agent-based implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization technique for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. 
It includes two types of agents: Ant representing ants, and Map which represents the map they're exploring.
<h3>Create the Map agent</h3>	
This example starts with the creation of the Map agent. To do so, please <button class="btn btn-default" ng-click="aesc.createMapAgent()">click here</button>. 
Do this only once.
<h3>Create 10 Ant agents</h3>	
After the Map agent has been created, create 10 Ant agents and let them explore the Map. To do so, please <button class="btn btn-primary" ng-click="aesc.createAntAgents()">click here</button>. 
Do this only once, too.
<h3>Stop the search</h3>	
If you want to stop all ants, please <button class="btn btn-primary" ng-click="aesc.sendMessageToCancelAntSearch()">click here</button>. 
If you stop ant agents, you have also stopped the Map agent. So, if you want to start the search again, click on the button for creation of 
Map agent, and then click on the button for creation of Ant agents.
